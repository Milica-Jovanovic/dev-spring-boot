In the Spring Framework, a "bean" refers to an object that is instantiated and managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

By default, when our application starts, all beans are initialized.
Spring will create an instance of each and make them available.

Instead we can use Lazy Initialization with annotation @Lazy and bean will be initialized in the following cases:
    - it is needed for dependency injection
    - or it is explicitly requested

If @Lazy is used in the class and that class is not called to be used anywhere, then it's not initialized at start
